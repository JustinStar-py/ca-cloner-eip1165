# ca-cloner-eip1165
The smart contract will be designed to allow users to input the address of the token they want to clone, as well as specify the parameters for the new token, such as the name, symbol, and total supply. Once the parameters are set, the contract will create a new token with the specified properties and distribute it to the creator's address.
